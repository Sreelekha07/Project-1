# Random Password Generator

This is a simple Python-based Random Password Generator program that allows users to create secure passwords based on their preferences. The program prompts the user for the desired length of the password which should be at least more than ten characters and generates a random password that includes a combination of upper-case and lower-case letters, digits, and special characters.

## Features

1. Generates random passwords with a specified length.
2. Ensures the password contains a combination of upper-case, lower-case letters, digits, and special characters.
3. Includes error handling to validate user input(ensures that the password length is greater than 10).

## Requirements

This project uses Pythonâ€™s standard library, so no additional dependencies are required.
Program: Tested on Python 3.12.3

## Modules Used

1. `string` - To access different character sets like letters, digits, and punctuation.
2. `random` - To generate random choices from the character sets.
